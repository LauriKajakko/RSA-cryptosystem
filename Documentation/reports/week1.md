# Week 1

## What has been done

I spent a lot of time researching topics and picked this one because
I just did the cyber security mooc and it got me interested.

I also created all the necessary things for the first week's deadline 
(maven project, git/github repository, labtool etc.) and  started researching
my topic some more.  

## Progress

Started and created the project. Researched the topic. 

## What I've Learned


## Problems

I'm not very familiar with cryptosystems in general and it's been a while
since I last time have studied math but I like a challenge. 

I think it's only a matter of finding the right material.
