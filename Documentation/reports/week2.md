# Week 2

## What has been done
Coding the core and necessary requirements added.

Hours: 3

## Progress

Core for RSA is ready. Checkstyle, junit tests, jacoco reports and other necessary stuff added.

## What I've Learned

About the implementation of RSA and about padding and hashing

## Problems

* Is hashing and padding too time consuming for this course?

* Is it possible to get a 5 without those?
