# Week 3

## What has been done

Researching miller-rabin, extended euclidean algorithm and gcd.

Hours: 5

## Progress

Made message converter class for encoding strings to ascii big integers and vice versa.

## What I've Learned

Converting strings to numbers. Getting a better understanding of the algorithms inside RSA.

## Problems

* how is message size determined by the key size

## What's next

* answer to the problem
* starting to implement the algorithms
* if the current message conversion is inefficient or doesn't support big enough messages then it needs to be redone
