# Week 5

## What has been done

Made a working miller-rabin and made some decisions on how to structure things when my own implementations go are used in the RSA-algorithm.

Hours: 5

## Progress

Miller-Rabin works

## What I've Learned

I've finally got a good grasp on the subject.

## Problems

None

## What's next

- Implementing extended euclidean, combining implemented algorithms together for the main RSA
- Making some kind of an ui for actually using this thing
