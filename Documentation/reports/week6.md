# Week 5

## What has been done

Everything is put together.

Hours: 15 (?)

## Progress

* Required documentation done or started (should be enough for week 6)
* Combined my own algorithms to work with RSA
* Unit test to see that it works
* Made a release so it's easier to use
* cleaned repository
* Wrong kind of performance tests done
  * Will be done next week
* Text UI
* executable jar (the release)

## What I've Learned

Well not much new at this point

## Problems

How can I improve this? Is it good enough?

## What's next

* Find out if there is optimization that can be done
* See if there is enough time for SHA because it seems interesting
* Finish all the documentation and test the remaining braches
